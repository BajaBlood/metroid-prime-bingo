# Welcome

Welcome to the wacky world of Metroid Prime Randomizer Bingo. Here, players race to fill squares on a not-so-traditional 5x5 bingo card by completing tasks such as "Defeat Hive Mecha" or "Activate the Observatory".

# Getting Started

1) If you have not already, familiarize yourself with how to generate and play [Metroid Prime Randomizer seeds](https://randomizer.metroidprime.run/).
2) Generate a seed and distribute to the other players. Randomizer presets tailored specifically for Bingo can be found on the [Presets Page](presets.md)
3) Create a room on [Bingosync](https://www.bingosync.com/) for *Metroid Prime* like so:

4) Have all participants join the room using the password set above.
5) Reveal the card and start the game when appropriate. Fill tiles on the board as they are completed. Have fun!

## Modes

There are various Bingo objectives which you can use as the goal. While you are welcome to use any objectives you would like, Prime Bingo has been balanced with the following modes in mind:

### Triple Bingo (1+ players)

The board is revealed when time starts. The game is over when a player completes 3 horizontal, vertical or diagonal lines on the board.

### Lockout (2 Players)

When creating the Bingosync room, choose "Lockout" as the Mode.

The board is revealed when time starts. The first player to complete any 13 tiles wins. Each tile can only be completed by 1 player. Clicking on the corresponding square on Bingosync "locks" the other player from being able to complete that tile. If one player completes an objective, but forgets to click a tile before the other player completes that same objective, the tile goes to the first player to actually click the tile on Bingosync.

### Double Anti-Bingo (DAB) (2+ Players)

"Double" means that 2 lines are needed to win. "Anti-Bingo" means that each player will be forced to complete 1 line of an opponent's choosing. 

The board is revealed to all players prior to the start of the race. After all the participants have been determined, a circular order of assignment is created randomly. For example:
```
Player 1 -> Player 2 -> Player 3 -> Player 1
```

Following this assignment order, players discretely decide a row, column or diagonal which their assignee must complete during the game. Once all players are ready, each player announces the line which they have chosen for their assignee. As soon as the last player has been informed of their forced line, time begins and gameplay starts. Optionally, you may choose to implement a rule here where each line can only have at most 1 player assigned to it (less fair; more interesting).

The winner is the first player to complete all bingo tiles in the forced line in addition to all tiles in any other 2nd line. Forced lines cannot be changed after being revealed at the start of the game. The self-determined 2nd line does not have to be revealed publicly and can be changed freely. The order of line completion does not matter.

## Variants

### Randomizer Balanced

The normal board. Goals are weighted based on pre-determined difficulty levels and placed logically to make a balanced board. Great for races.

### Randomizer Chaos

Goals are unweighted and therefore placed entirely at random. More variety, but some very unbalanced boards are possible.
